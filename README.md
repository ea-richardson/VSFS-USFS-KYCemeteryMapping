# VSFS-USFS-KYCemeteryMapping

## Overview
The **VSFS-USFS-KYCemeteryMapping** repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to streamline and automate GIS workflows for historical cemetery mapping in Kentucky. This project is conducted county by county, and it is sponsored by the **Redbird Ranger District** - **Daniel Boone National Forest** - **USDA Forest Service** through the **Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS)** program.

The notebook is intended to be run in **ArcGIS Pro** and serves as a tool for improving the efficiency of historical cemetery mapping, leveraging GIS data and spatial analysis.
